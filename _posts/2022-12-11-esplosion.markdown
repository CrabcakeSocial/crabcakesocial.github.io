# Bad News

I made some errors as an admin that broke Crabcake.social in ways that I couldn't recover from. I'm not saying the site was unrecoverable. I'm saying that I as a new Mastodon admin didn't know how to fix them.

Since they seemed like the sort of errors that would compound over time I decided to start over with a clean install of Mastodon.

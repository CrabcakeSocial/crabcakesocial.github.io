# Background

Crabcake.social is a Mastodon instance. We are a general-purpose community originally comprised of users living near the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia. Living nearby is not a requirement, however. Anyone is invited to join provided they abide by the community standards.

# Hardware

Crabcake is currently hosted on a [Hetzner VPS][hetzner] in Ashburn, Virginia. We have three CPU threads, 4 GB RAM, and use [Amazon S3 storage][s3] for uploaded files and media.

I calculate that this should be sufficient for several dozen active users or even 100 lazy ones. Regardless, CPU and RAM will be easy to scale upwards if we need to.

I do *not* plan to let the site grow unbounded; there will be an upper limit at some point.
